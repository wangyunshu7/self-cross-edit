Image Description: "a {class_A} and a {class_B}"
1) Is there {class_A} appearing in this image? Give a True/False answer after reasoning.
2) Is the generated {class_A} recognizable and regular (without artifacts) in terms of its shape and semantic structure only? For example, answer False if a two-leg animal has three or more legs, or a two-eye animal has four eyes, or a two-ear animal has one or three ears. Ignore style, object size in comparison to its surroundings. Give a True/False answer after reasoning.
3) Is there {class_B} appearing in this image? Give a True/False answer after reasoning.
4) Is the generated {class_B} recognizable and regular (without artifacts) in terms of its shape and semantic structure only? For example, answer False if a two-leg animal has three or more legs, or a two-eye animal has four eyes, or a two-ear animal has one or three ears. Ignore style, object size in comparison to its surroundings. Give a True/False answer after reasoning.
5) Is the generated content a mixture of {class_A} and {class_B}? An example of mixture is that Sphinx resembles a mixture of a person and a lion. Give a True/False answer after reasoning.
